![coding-924920_1280](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76985209/122139838-b65f0580-cdfe-11eb-997f-b33097a47d0c.jpg)

We made a series of visualizations pulled from the [Kaggle Data Science Job Posting on Glassdoor Dataset ](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/data-science-job-posting-on-glassdoor/code). This was data scraped in early 2021 & it reflects data from 2020. 

## We wanted to answer these specific questions:
  * What locations have the most data science job postings?
  * What industries have the highest demand for data scientists?
  * What are the most desirable skills?
  * What is the average salary by state?
  
## Our project includes:
  * Python Flask–powered API
  * D3
  * Plotly
  * HTML/CSS 
  * JavaScript & jQuery 
  * SQL
